# PiFrame
e-paper display for a raspberry pi

PiFrame is a simple project using a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, with headers if you aren't comfortable soldering your own, and a Waveshare 7.3in 7-color display. I wanted to be able to display the weather as well as my calendar, and I wanted to use the same utilities I use in the terminal- namely wttr.in for weather and remind for a calendar.
